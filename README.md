Good day, 

My presentation can be found in 'misc/EXUS.pdf'

The final model (an XGBOOST) can be found in 'artefacts/model.sav'

My code can all be found under notebooks, and the data files in data. 

Thank you for your time, please feel free to reach out to me if there are any questions or something is not clear.
